// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WidgetCatalog — the registry of available widgets.
//
// Each entry is defined ONCE here and reused everywhere: the dashboard grid,
// the expanded overlay, and the edit-mode "add widget" picker. `source` is the
// qrc path to the widget's QML file (all widgets live under qrc:/qml/ via
// qml.qrc aliases). `defaults` seeds a fresh instance's persisted settings.
//
// SIZES — `sizes` lists the sizes (names from WidgetSizes) a widget can honestly
// render, and `dflt` is what a fresh instance gets. Every entry declares the `1x1`
// baseline: a widget that cannot do the default size is a bug. The list is a
// CAPABILITY claim, not a menu of everything that would technically lay out, and it
// is judged against two hard facts:
//   • The screen ROTATES. A size is (short × long), so declaring one means the
//     widget works in BOTH of its shapes — `0.5x1` is a ~348x853 column in portrait
//     and a ~853x306 banner in landscape.
//   • Bigger is not better. `1x3` is the WHOLE screen (~770x2560): only content that
//     actually grows into it earns it. Almost nothing here does — a lone ring or a
//     glyph at full screen is a stretched card, not a feature. Likewise `0.5x0.5`
//     (1/12, ~348x409 portrait / ~423x306 landscape) is where the 36px chrome header
//     and any fixed control row stop fitting.
// Comments below explain the non-obvious ABSENCES only.
