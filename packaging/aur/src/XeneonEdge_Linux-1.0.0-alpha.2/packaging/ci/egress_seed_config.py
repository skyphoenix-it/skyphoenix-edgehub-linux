"""Seed an isolated hub config.toml for the no-egress attestation.

Usage: egress_seed_config.py <config_dir> <mode> [url]

Modes:
  default   Write NOTHING. A pristine config dir is what a new install has, and
            the claim under test is about the DEFAULT hub, so the run must not
            be handed a config the hub itself would not have written.
  seeded    first_run_complete + no ui_state -> the hub seeds its default
            starter layout ("productivity"). This is the post-wizard default
            dashboard, which `default` (still on the wizard) never reaches.
  weather   One Weather tile. Weather has no required settings (it defaults to
            Berlin) and fetches ~350 ms after load, so this needs no interaction.
  url       One HTTP/JSON tile pointed at <url>. This is the negative control:
            an arbitrary host is exactly what "the app phones home" looks like.

Schema rules the Rust core is strict about (learned in tests/runtime/, see that
README): the config is NESTED — [display]/[theme]/[startup]/[widgets] are
required tables, and a flat layout deserialize-fails, gets salvaged into the
default layout, and silently discards the seed. `ui_state` must be a
single-quoted TOML *literal* string: the embedded JSON has double quotes, and a
basic "..." string with \\"-escapes is rejected.
