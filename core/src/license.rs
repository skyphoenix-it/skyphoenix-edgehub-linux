//! Offline licence-key verification (E11).
//!
//! The Pro tier is unlocked by a signed key the user pastes into a dialog. The
//! design constraints are deliberate and non-negotiable:
//!
//! * **Offline.** Verification is a signature check against a public key
//!   compiled into this binary. It opens no socket and reads no file — running
//!   the hub under `unshare -n` cannot change the answer.
//! * **No hardware fingerprint.** A key is bound to nothing but its own
//!   contents. It keeps working on a reinstall, a new machine, or a VM.
//! * **Verify, never mint.** Only the PUBLIC half lives here. Nothing in this
//!   repository can produce a licence: the private key is offline and the
//!   `rand_core` feature of `ed25519-dalek` is switched off, so this crate
//!   cannot even generate a keypair. The test module below signs with a key
//!   that exists solely under `#[cfg(test)]`.
//! * **Fail closed, but soft.** Every failure path — absent, truncated,
//!   garbage, forged, expired — resolves to [`Tier::Free`]. There is no panic
//!   and no nag: a broken key means the free product, not a broken product.
//!   Expiry is reported as its own state so the UI can say "renew" rather than
//!   the accusatory "invalid".
//!
//! # Key format
//!
//! ```text
//! XE1.<base64url(payload JSON)>.<base64url(64-byte Ed25519 signature)>
//! ```
//!
//! The signature covers the ASCII bytes of `XE1.<base64url(payload)>` — the
//! encoded form, not the decoded JSON. This is the JWT rule and it exists for a
//! reason: verifying the exact bytes that are later parsed means no JSON
//! canonicalisation question can ever arise (key order, whitespace and escaping
//! are all frozen by the signature). Covering the `XE1` prefix too means the
//! version cannot be stripped or downgraded without breaking the signature.
//!
//! `base64url` **unpadded** (RFC 4648 §5) is used throughout: the alphabet has
//! no `+`, `/` or `=`, so a key survives being pasted into a URL, a shell, a
//! CSV or an email without escaping — the places keys actually travel.
//!
//! NOTHING here may log a key or its holder. [`License`] therefore has a
//! hand-written [`Debug`] that redacts `issued_to`, and the error type names
//! only the failure mode. This mirrors `secrets.rs`, which draws the same line.
