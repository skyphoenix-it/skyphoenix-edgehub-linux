//! Distro identity, installed-package count, and system age.
//!
//! All of this is READ-ONLY and unprivileged. Nothing here mutates a package
//! database, and nothing here spawns a process - see the `Rpm` arm of [`probe`]
//! for the one place that costs us a feature, and why we pay it.
//!
//! Everything is rooted at an injectable `root` path rather than a hard-coded
//! `/`, so the whole probe is testable against a fixture tree. Production
//! passes `/`.
//!
//! ## Why there is no "updates available"
//!
//! Both families make "is there an update?" expensive, not cheap:
//!   * pacman's sync databases (`/var/lib/pacman/sync/*.db`) are gzipped
//!     tarballs; answering means decompressing them and reimplementing pacman's
//!     own version-comparison (`vercmp`) rules per package.
//!   * apt's answer needs a full dependency resolution against
//!     `/var/lib/apt/lists`, which is why `apt list --upgradable` is slow.
//!
//! Both also depend on how recently the user synced, so a number derived from a
//! stale cache is a *lie with a plausible face* ("0 updates" on a box that is
//! six months behind). We report "unknown" instead.
