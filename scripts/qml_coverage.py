# qml_coverage.py - QML behavior-matrix coverage analyzer (read-only, stdlib only).
#
# There is no trustworthy line-coverage tool for QML, so we treat QML coverage as
# a *behavior traceability matrix*: enumerate the behaviors the source exposes
# (functions, config-schema field ids, widget types, background/wallpaper catalog
# entries) and count how many are claimed-and-backed by a `tst_*.qml` test.
#
# A test file claims behaviors via a header convention:
#     // COVERS: fn:Dashboard.cfgAction, schema:showSeconds, widget:cpu
# A claim is only honored if the file actually asserts: the claimed id's leaf
# token must appear inside an assertion call (compare/verify/tryCompare/
# tryVerify/fuzzyCompare) in that same file. Unbacked claims are rejected so a
# test cannot inflate coverage by merely declaring a header with no real check.
#
# One narrow extra form is honored: a COLLECTION claim `widget:*` / `bg:*` /
# `wallpaper:*`. A test that genuinely iterates the whole catalog under assertion
# (instantiates the catalog, asserts its full `.length`, and loops over that same
# collection) exercises EVERY entry, so such a claim credits every enumerated id
# of that kind. This is restricted to the three catalogs and still requires a real
# iteration+assertion - it is NOT a blanket pass, and only these three `*` kinds
# are recognised (`fn:*`, `schema:*`, etc. are rejected as unknown collections).
#
# Run `python3 scripts/qml_coverage.py --selftest` to verify the honesty
# guarantees (reject-unknown-id, reject-unbacked-claim, credit-backed-claim, and
# the collection rules) independently of the repository's own test files.
#
# Exit 0 if covered/total >= THRESHOLD, else exit 1. Read-only: never writes.
