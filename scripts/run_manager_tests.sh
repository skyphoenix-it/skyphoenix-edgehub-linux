#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_manager_tests.sh — the REAL Manager, driven with REAL input, against the
# REAL hub. No nested compositor, no stubbed backend.
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
#
# The Manager used to be "tested" inside a nested kwin_wayland with its C++
# backend stubbed out (screensJson()="[]", metricsJson()="{}"). That was not the
# shipped Manager, and its pixel assertions were false besides: Qt's
# TestCase.grabImage(item) crops at (0,0) and ignores item position, so
# "did the preview repaint?" was sampling the nav sidebar. Those tests were
# deleted 2026-07-20 and scripts/check_no_manager_compositor_tests.sh keeps them
# out.
#
# Meanwhile the REAL tests — the ones that launch both binaries and talk over the
# control socket — already existed and were ORPHANED: no runner, no workflow,
# never executed. That is the same disease. This script is the fix.
#
# GATES. Both are required and neither is implied by the other:
#   XENEON_HW_INPUT=1          — synthetic input at all
#   XENEON_HW_INPUT_DESKTOP=1  — input on the DESKTOP (the Manager lives there,
#                                not on the Edge). The cursor moves on your
#                                screen; any real input from you aborts the run.
# Without them every suite here SKIPs loudly rather than silently passing.
#
# Requires the Edge connected and binaries matching the working tree — the
# suites assert that themselves and refuse to run stale (reconfigure, don't just
# rebuild: git describe is evaluated at configure time).
