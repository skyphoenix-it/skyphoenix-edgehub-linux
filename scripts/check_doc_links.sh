# check_doc_links.sh — every relative link in our markdown must resolve.
#
# Extracted from an inline docs.yml step that had two bugs:
#
#   1. It tested `[ -e "docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#release-signing" ]` — anchor and
#      all — so a PERFECTLY VALID anchor link was reported broken and docs.yml
#      went red on master. The link was right; the checker was wrong. A gate
#      that cries wolf gets ignored, which is how the OTHER real breakage below
#      survived.
#   2. It only scanned `README.md` + `docs/**`, so SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md,
#      ROADMAP.md and friends were never checked. Both had dead links; the
#      security policy's were pointing at things that never existed.
#
# So this checks every tracked or newly created .md, strips the anchor before
# the file test, and — when the target is markdown — verifies the anchor actually
# names a heading, because a link to a renamed heading is broken in the way that
# matters to a reader even though the file still exists. Including untracked
# files keeps the local pre-commit check equivalent to CI after those files are
# added to the commit.
