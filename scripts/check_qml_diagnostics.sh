# check_qml_diagnostics.sh - fail on QML runtime diagnostics in a test log.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# The hub's Settings->Background picker shipped completely inert: a QML
# self-binding trap meant every interaction threw
#     TypeError: Cannot call method 'setAppearance' of undefined
# on every click. Three test files covering that picker passed 5/5, 16/16 and
# 16/16 -- identically with and without the bug -- because nothing anywhere in
# the test infrastructure treated a QML runtime error as a failure.
#
# STREAM NOTE (measured, not assumed): qmltestrunner reports these as `QWARN`
# lines on STDOUT, not stderr. An earlier version of this gate grepped stderr,
# found zero, and was itself vacuous. Feed it the STDOUT log.
#
# Usage: check_qml_diagnostics.sh <logfile> [--tier offscreen|composed]
set -uo pipefail

# Resource-resolution failures. In the OFFSCREEN tier the .qrc is compiled into
# the app binaries and is genuinely absent from qmltestrunner, so these are
# harness artifacts (2391 of them in a 15-file sample) and are reported but not
# enforced. In a COMPOSED tier -- tests/gui under a real compositor, or the real
# binaries -- the resources ARE present, so a miss is a real broken asset.
