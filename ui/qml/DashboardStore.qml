//
// Owns the persisted UI-state document (layout + per-widget settings +
// appearance) and mediates all reads/writes. Persistence goes through the C++
// `configBridge` (→ Rust config, atomic XDG write). Reactivity is provided by
// `revision`: every mutation bumps it, so widgets that bind through it re-read
// automatically - this is what lets a tile and its expanded overlay (two
// separate instances) share the same live state.
//
// Document schema (JSON):
//   {
//     "version": 1,
//     "appearance": { themeMode, accent, glass, glow, reduceMotion },
//     "pages": [ { "name": "System", "tiles": [ { "id": "...", "type": "cpu",
//                                                 "size": "1x1" } ] } ],

//
// `size` is a NAMED size from WidgetSizes (see that file for what a name means).
// It replaced the old `w`/`h` span pair, and it is a NEW KEY rather than a
// reinterpretation of the old ones for one decisive reason: a new key makes an
// old document STRUCTURALLY DETECTABLE. `size === undefined` ⇒ pre-migration,
// full stop. Reusing `w`/`h` would have silently reinterpreted them - old `h:2`
// meant "twice as tall as my siblings", new means "two thirds of the screen" -
// and there would have been no way to tell a migrated tile from a stale one.
// `version` cannot serve as that guard: it is WRITTEN (here and by
// PresetCatalog) but never read or branched on anywhere in the codebase, so
// every document on disk claims `1` regardless of its actual shape.
