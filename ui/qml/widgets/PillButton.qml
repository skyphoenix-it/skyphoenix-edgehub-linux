// PillButton — uniform, touch-friendly button used across all widgets.
//
// SIZING (why the box is what it is):
// The pill hosts two runs with genuinely different font metrics, and the box is
// derived from BOTH rather than sized for latin and hoped-for by the glyph:
//   • a latin label run — at pixelSize 18 its box is 25 tall (ascent 1.068em +
//     descent 0.293em ≈ 1.39em) and its ink sits INSIDE that box with real side
//     bearing.
//   • an emoji glyph run — Noto Color Emoji is a CBDT bitmap strike, so Qt
//     reports line height 1.0em and advance 1.0625em. At pixelSize 18 that box
//     is 19.125x18 and the ink FILLS it: measured ink bbox (2,-1)-(17,17), i.e.
//     zero bearing, overshooting the reported box by a pixel at the top.
// So an emoji has no slack to give. Two consequences are designed for here:
//   1. the glyph is sized RELATIVE to the label (below), never fixed, and
//   2. under width pressure the LABEL elides — the glyph is atomic and can only
//      be cut, so it must never be the thing that gives way.
