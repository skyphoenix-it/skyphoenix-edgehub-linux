// Habit streak - daily check-ins with a real streak count + heatmap.
// Persisted; streak is computed from consecutive days ending today/yesterday.
//
// Sizing (W1 wave 2b): the heatmap used to be expanded-only, on the reasoning
// (still in WidgetCatalog) that "a tile shows a streak number + one button,
// whatever room it is given". That outlived its truth: the 28-day grid is 7x4
// cells, which fits a 696x819 baseline tile with room to spare - so a tile with
// the space now earns the history rather than showing a lone number in a big box.
//   • 0.5x0.5 (micro) - headerless: the streak number + Check in. The heatmap is
//                       genuinely too small to read at 348x409, so it stays off.
//   • 1x1 (baseline)  - streak + the 28-day heatmap + Check in.
//   • wide            - the streak/button column BESIDE the heatmap.
//   • tall            - streak, heatmap, button stacked; the map transposes to
//                       4x7 so it fits the box instead of sitting as a squat
//                       block in a column of air (see heatCols).
//   • full (overlay)  - streak + best + heatmap + button, sized by the pane it is
//                       actually given (see streakPx). It is NOT a full screen:
//                       Dashboard hosts it in a live-preview pane beside the
//                       config form - ~941x456 in landscape, ~656x980 stacked in
//                       portrait - so "full" is a class like any other and reads
//                       its own box rather than a set of literals.
// The check-in button is a PillButton (theme.touchSecondary) at every size - it is
// the whole interaction, so it is never shrunk to make a layout fit.
//
// Sizing (W1 wave 2c): 1x1.5 - a half screen, and NOT the baseline stretched. It
// projects to two genuinely different boxes, and gets a different card in each:
//   • portrait 696x1229 (tall) - the 4x7 map above the streak, the record and the
//                                button. Cells reach ~86px vs the baseline's 34.
//   • landscape 1269x612 (wide) - the 7x4 map BESIDE the streak/record/button
//                                 column.
// What it earns over 1x1 is CONTENT, not scale: the best-ever record line, which
// was `visible: w.expanded` and so appeared in the overlay while a half-screen
// tile with twice the baseline's room went without it (see showBest).
// NOT 1x2/1x3: the stored history is pruned to 28 days, so past a half screen
// there is nothing further to show and the map would only inflate.
