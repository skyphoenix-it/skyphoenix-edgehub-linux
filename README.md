# EdgeHub

**Pick the screen for what you're doing, and it's built for you.**

EdgeHub by [SKYPhoenix IT](https://skyphoenix-it.com) is a native Linux widget
dashboard designed for the Corsair Xeneon Edge and selected secondary/portrait
touchscreens. No browser, Electron, web server, account or telemetry implementation
is required. Broad display and desktop support remains evidence-gated.

## What it is

The Corsair Xeneon Edge is a 2560×720 secondary touchscreen that works in either orientation. EdgeHub gives it - and other secondary or portrait displays - a purpose-built home screen: swipeable pages of live widgets you arrange by touch, right on the device.

**Who it's for:** anyone with a second screen they don't want to waste. Developers watching a build. Homelab owners watching a rack. People who want a calm timer and the weather instead of another browser window.

- **Native, without Chromium.** A Rust core handles metrics and configuration;
  Qt 6/QML draws the UI. Resource limits are measured separately and the current
  development build does not yet meet its RSS gates.
- **Designed for touch.** Large targets, swipe between pages, in-widget controls, on-device settings. You never need a keyboard to use it.
- **It finds the right screen.** Display detection puts EdgeHub on your Edge (or a display you choose), and a real HID orientation sensor follows the panel when you flip it.
- **Design it from your desk.** The companion **EdgeHub Manager** is a live clone of your Edge - drag, reorder, resize, and restyle from your main monitor.

## 19 ready-made screens

You don't start from a blank grid. Each preset is a designed layout - a small, purposeful set of widgets, with a fitting background and motion character.

| Screen | For |
|---|---|
| **Calm Focus** | Deep work, quietly. A big timer, your one thing, and a place to dump distractions. |
| **Notes & Streak** | A scratchpad and habit streak for keeping momentum visible. |
| **Home** | Time, weather and media in one everyday screen. |
| **Ambient** | A quiet clock, weather and moon view. |
| **Remote Work** | The time, your calendar, today's tasks, and how much workday is left. |
| **Developer** | Your build and your box, side by side - CI status, a number you watch, machine health. |
| **Homelab Ops** | Service uptime and container health beside CPU, memory, network and disk. |
| **Gaming Cockpit** | Rig telemetry beside your game - GPU/CPU temps, memory, network. |
| **Trading Desk** | Your time and the market's, two numbers that matter, and what's next. |
| **Health & Routine** | Gentle nudges toward a good day - water, breaks, and a daily streak. |
| **Creator / Media** | Now-playing front and centre, a focus timer, and a spark of inspiration. |
| **System Core** | CPU, GPU and memory at a glance. |
| **System I/O** | Network, disk and sensor detail. |
| **Day Plan** | Agenda, tasks and the shape of the workday. |
| **Minimalist** | Almost nothing. A clock, the weather, and the moon. |
| **Analyst / Data** | Two headline numbers, a monitoring feed, the time and your tasks. |
| **Student / Study** | A focus timer, your tasks, a countdown to the exam, and a streak. |
| **Productivity** | Focus, tasks, a habit streak and your day's progress, with system stats a swipe away. |
| **Enterprise / Locked** | A clean, managed baseline - time, agenda, workday, and one approved team number. |

Applying a preset keeps *your* theme and accent - it changes the screen, not your taste.

The data-connected presets (Developer, Homelab Ops, Trading Desk, Analyst, Enterprise) ship their data tiles **labelled but deliberately unconnected** - "CI status → Add a URL in settings". A preset never guesses an endpoint, so a fresh install never polls a stranger's host.

*Defined in [`ui/qml/PresetCatalog.qml`](ui/qml/PresetCatalog.qml).*

## 30 widgets

| Category | Widgets |
|----------|---------|
| **System** (8) | CPU load & temp, GPU (AMD Radeon utilization & temp), Memory, Network throughput, Disk usage, combined Sensors, installed Packages, System Age |
| **Data** (2) | **HTTP / JSON** - poll any endpoint, pull a value out by path, show it as a number, gauge or list · **KPI** - one number that matters, from a URL *or a local file*, with colour-coded thresholds |
| **Time** (3) | Clock (**real IANA time zones - daylight saving included**), Analog Clock, Moon Phase |
| **Focus** (10) | Focus Timer (Pomodoro), Tasks, Right Now, Quick Note, Habit Streak, Hydration, Break Reminder, Meds, Braindump, Routine |
| **Media** (1) | Now Playing (MPRIS - Spotify, browsers, any player on the machine) |
| **Info** (6) | Calendar (subscribe via ICS URL), Now / Next, Weather (Open-Meteo), Countdown, End of Day, Daily Quote |

System metrics come from the Rust core and the kernel. Focus, task, note, habit and hydration widgets persist your data locally.

**Real time zones, properly.** The clock is backed by a `QTimeZone` bridge, so it follows actual IANA rules - every zone your OS `tzdata` knows (~600), daylight saving included, and correct through a `tzdata` update with no code change. QML has no `Intl`, and `Date.toLocaleString(…, { timeZone })` silently returns host-local time - which is exactly the kind of quiet wrongness a clock cannot afford.

*Defined in [`ui/qml/WidgetCatalog.qml`](ui/qml/WidgetCatalog.qml).*

---

## Connect your own data

The **HTTP/JSON** and **KPI** widgets point at *your* endpoint: a CI status, a queue depth, a P&L number, a Prometheus query, a file on disk. No integration, no account, no vendor. KPI's local-file source works with no network at all.

**Credentials are references, not secrets.** Write `${env:MY_TOKEN}` or `file:/run/secrets/token`, and the value is read at request time and **never written to your config**. A token typed in directly still works - the app tells you it's in plain text so you can migrate.

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `${env:VAR}` | Read environment variable `VAR` at request time |
| `file:/path/to/token` | Read the file's contents at request time |
| anything else | A plaintext literal - still honoured, and flagged in the UI |

*Implemented in [`core/src/secrets.rs`](core/src/secrets.rs).*

---

## Privacy, enforced rather than asserted

Most apps promise they don't phone home. EdgeHub's design makes the promise checkable.

- **One audited egress gate.** Every outbound request goes through [`NetHub.request()`](ui/qml/widgets/NetHub.qml) - the only place in the QML tree that may construct a network call. It owns a **global offline kill switch**, a **per-host allowlist**, and **per-host counters** for what was actually sent.
- **A lint enforces it.** [`scripts/check_no_raw_xhr.sh`](scripts/check_no_raw_xhr.sh) fails if any file outside the gate constructs its own request, and also fails if the gate stops being the one construction site. It runs as a suite in [`scripts/run_all_tests.sh`](scripts/run_all_tests.sh). There is no exemption list - an exception there would be a hole in the claim, not a lint detail.
- **Unknown schemes are refused, not guessed.** The gate recognises a fixed set of local forms (`file:`, `qrc:`, bare paths). Anything else is egress. An earlier shape treated every unknown scheme as local, so a `webcal://` calendar URL skipped both the kill switch and the allowlist - that class of bug is now structurally impossible.
- **The Rust core has no network stack at all.** "No outbound" is true there by construction, not by policy.
- **Your config stays yours.** Plain TOML at `~/.config/xeneon-edge-hub/config.toml`, written atomically and **owner-only (`0600`) at creation** - not chmod'd afterwards, so a credential is never briefly world-readable.
- **No telemetry, no account, no cloud.** EdgeHub touches the network only for widgets you explicitly configure - Weather, a Calendar feed, or a data widget you pointed somewhere. All of it through the same gate.

### Performance

No passing CPU or memory number is claimed for a release candidate. A formal
2026-07-21 run measured the current dirty development binary with a reproducible
target-panel profile: startup passed at 0.223 s and average CPU passed at 0.120%
idle / 2.053% active, but peak RSS failed at 408.094 MiB idle (`<150 MiB` required)
and 472.820 MiB with the exact 10-widget load (`<250 MiB` required). The aggregate
result is **FAIL**, and the required 24/48-hour evidence is still incomplete.

## Make it yours

- **29 themes** - 20 free themes and 9 optional Pro themes, including dark,
  light, OLED, high-contrast, Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, Synthwave and more.
- **29 accent colors** - 14 standard tones, the 8 published **Okabe–Ito**
  colors, and 7 theme-completing accents.
- **10 animated backgrounds plus Gradient** - orbs, waves, starfield, mesh,
  aurora, bokeh, grid, Arch Peaks, Fedora Loops and Aubergine Ribbons - plus
  static wallpapers, settable globally or per page.
- **Glass, glow, and a reduced-motion mode.** One shared design system keeps every widget consistent.
- **Edit mode** to add, remove, move and resize tiles across multiple pages, with schema-driven per-widget configuration.
- **First-run wizard**, on-device **Settings**, and a **Diagnostics** screen.

### EdgeHub Manager

A companion desktop app (`xeneon-edge-manager`) that mirrors your Edge in real time over a control socket, with Dark / Light / Default chrome:

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Layout** | Drag, reorder and resize tiles on a live clone of your Edge |
| **Appearance** | Themes, accents, backgrounds, glass/glow |
| **Images** | Wallpapers and per-widget imagery |
| **Display** | Pick and orient the target screen |
| **About** | Version and project info |

## Install

The current release is **[v1.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/skyphoenix-it/skyphoenix-edgehub-linux/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1)**.

### Portable tarball (compatible x86-64 distributions)

Download `xeneon-edge-hub_1.0.0-beta.1_x86_64.tar.gz`, `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` from the [release page](https://github.com/skyphoenix-it/skyphoenix-edgehub-linux/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1), then:

```sh
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS   # key import: see "Verifying your download"
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
tar -xf xeneon-edge-hub_1.0.0-beta.1_x86_64.tar.gz
```

The tarball is a relocatable `/usr` payload, not a self-contained bundle: its
binaries use the build host's glibc floor and the target system's Qt 6.5+
libraries. The current maintainer build requires glibc 2.39 or newer. After
extracting, run the Hub or Manager from the archive's `usr/bin/` directory, or
use a native package on the supported distributions. An AppImage, when attached
to a release, bundles Qt for systems that do not provide a compatible version.

An AUR recipe exists in [`packaging/aur/PKGBUILD`](packaging/aur/PKGBUILD), but
the presence of a recipe is not evidence that a current package is published or
release-gated. Use the tagged release assets or build from source unless the AUR
package's current status has been independently verified. (`v1.0.0-alpha.1`
remains unsigned because it predates the release key.)

### Verifying your download

The `v1.0.0-beta.1` release provides `SHA256SUMS` alongside a detached
`SHA256SUMS.asc`, made with the EdgeHub release key. (`v1.0.0-alpha.1` predates
the key and is checksum-only - it has no `.asc`.)

**1. Import the key.** It is not on a keyserver yet, so `gpg --recv-keys` will not find it. Use either route:

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/SimonKreitmayer.gpg | gpg --import   # from GitHub
gpg --import packaging/edgehub-signing.pub                        # from a clone
```

**2. Verify the signature, then the files:**

```sh
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS   # is the checksum list authentic?
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS                  # do the files match the list?
```

`gpg --verify` must say **Good signature** for this fingerprint:

```
SKYPhoenix IT <simon.kreitmayer@skyphoenix-it.com>
2F0C AD36 DC1D 46F3 347B  7EF2 93CD C77E ACF9 8990
```

**Check the fingerprint, not just the words "Good signature."** Any key can produce a good signature over anything - including one an attacker made and shipped next to a tampered download. The signature is only worth what the fingerprint is, so compare it against the line above (published here, in [`packaging/edgehub-signing.pub`](packaging/edgehub-signing.pub), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/SimonKreitmayer.gpg)).

gpg will also warn `This key is not certified with a trusted signature`. That is expected and not a failure: it means you haven't personally certified the key. Trust here rests on the fingerprint matching, not on the web of trust.

Policy, scope and key rotation: [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md#release-signing).

### Everything else

Build from source (below). AppImage, Flatpak, `.deb` and `.rpm` recipes are authored in this repo but are not yet published, verified artifacts - see [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md) for the honest status of each format. Fedora and Ubuntu packages are planned for v1.1.

---

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+ (stable)
- **C++17 compiler** (GCC 12+ or Clang 16+)
- **CMake** 3.22+
- **Qt 6.5+** with development headers (QtQuick, QtWayland, QtDBus, QtSvg)

**Arch / CachyOS**

```sh
sudo pacman -S rust cmake gcc qt6-base qt6-declarative qt6-wayland qt6-tools
```

**Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** - note that Ubuntu's apt Qt is 6.4.2; the project needs Qt ≥ 6.5, so install a newer Qt if apt's is too old.

```sh
sudo apt install cargo cmake g++ qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
  qt6-wayland-dev qt6-tools-dev libglib2.0-dev
```

### Build & run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/skyphoenix-it/skyphoenix-edgehub-linux.git
cd skyphoenix-edgehub-linux
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

./build/xeneon-edge-hub          # the on-device hub
./build/xeneon-edge-manager      # the companion Manager
```

`--reset` loads fresh defaults; `--reset-wizard` re-triggers the first-run wizard.

### Test

```sh
cd core && cargo test        # Rust core
./scripts/run_ui_tests.sh    # QML GUI suite (offscreen, no cmake needed)
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh   # everything: Rust + QML + ctest + behavior matrix + lints
```

---

## Architecture

```
Rust core (config · EDID · metrics · FFI)  ──C ABI──▶  Qt 6 / QML (hub + Manager)
                                                         │
                    local TOML config ◀── control-socket IPC · single-instance
```

- **Rust core** owns configuration, EDID display identity, and system metrics, and exposes a stable, hand-written C ABI. It has no network stack.
- **Qt 6/QML** renders both the hub and the Manager on top of that core. Widgets are declared once in a registry and reused by the grid, the expanded overlay, and the add-widget picker.
- The hub and Manager talk over a **control socket** (`QLocalServer`), which is how the Manager pushes a live layout to a running hub. The app is **single-instance**.

## Quality

The repository includes all of these verification layers:

| Layer | Result |
|---|---|
| **Real hardware** ([`tests/hardware/`](tests/hardware/README.md)) | Widget/catalog drift, portrait/landscape rendering, Manager-to-Hub integration, guarded synthetic touch and soak scenarios on a physical Edge |
| **Rust** | Unit tests, formatting, Clippy and coverage gate |
| **C++** | QtTest suites against the real core plus a coverage gate |
| **QML** | Offscreen and compositor-backed GUI suites plus a behavior matrix gated at 100% |
| **Lints** | Egress lint (no raw request outside the gate) and a widget-icon lint |
| **Runtime E2E** | Drives the real hub binary headless and asserts what it persists to `config.toml` |

The intended CI gate runs Rust format, Clippy, tests and dependency checks; the
build; docs/link checks; QML and C++ suites; and coverage at ≥95% - see
[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). The hardware suite needs a
physical Edge and therefore runs locally. A working-tree run is development
evidence, not a release certificate. The beta.1 decision and its accepted risks
are recorded in [`docs/BETA_PLAN.md`](docs/BETA_PLAN.md). Full plan:
[`docs/DEV_AND_TEST_PLAN.md`](docs/DEV_AND_TEST_PLAN.md).

The hardware suite asserts its widget list against `WidgetCatalog.qml`, so a new widget cannot go silently unexercised - a drift check added after the list had quietly omitted two widgets while still reporting green.

---

## Beta status

What is deliberately not claimed for beta.1:

- **Packaging is incomplete.** AppImage, Flatpak, `.deb` and `.rpm` recipes are
  authored, but native distro jobs still need candidate evidence and the
  AppImage zsync update round trip has never been exercised against a published
  release.
- **No formal performance or long-soak claim.** The release owner accepted the
  beta without the planned 48-hour soak, and earlier development RSS results do
  not support a release performance claim.
- **The current defaults are selected, not pending:** Nord, Atkinson Hyperlegible,
  animated background and widget glow off, with normal transitions on and a
  separate reduce-motion preference. Legal review of the Inspired themes and any
  payment/store delivery route remain open before a paid offering.
- **Weather and Calendar reach the network** for the feeds you configure - as designed, through the same audited gate as everything else.
- **The Manager follows a single-writer rule.** While the Hub is connected,
  display/autostart changes go over the control socket and the Hub persists them;
  the Manager writes directly only while it is the offline owner.
- **Physical rotation** is wired and debounced from the HID sensor, but only a person can turn a panel - so it's verified by hand, not by the suite.
- **GPU metrics are AMD Radeon only.**

---

## Roadmap

Beta.1 contains 30 widgets, 19 presets, the Manager, and expanded test and
release tooling. The next milestone remains evidence-led: address beta reports,
revisit resource targets, complete longer stability evidence, and verify any
newly advertised package lifecycle before broadening release claims.

Beyond 1.0: segment integration packs (OBS, MangoHud, Prometheus, smart home, market data), a WASM widget SDK, and internationalization.

Full plan: **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** · changes: **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** · overview: [`docs/marketing-site/index.html`](docs/marketing-site/index.html).
