    // ── The tile Repeater's model ────────────────────────────────────────────
    // `placements` is a fresh JS array every time it re-packs, and a Repeater handed
    // a new array resets its whole delegate model: every tile was destroyed and
    // rebuilt for a single reorder, so there was nothing left alive to animate and
    // the replacement was simply already at the destination. That is the teleport.
    //
    // This ListModel is SYNCED to `placements` by id instead: a tile that still
    // exists keeps its row, so it keeps its delegate, so it keeps its loaded widget
    // - and its new slot arrives as a property change it can EASE to (see animS/animL
    // on the cell). Dragging a tile is exactly where a teleport reads worst, which is
    // why the clone needs this at least as much as the hub does.
    //
    // Row order carries no meaning: a cell is positioned absolutely from its own
    // (s, l) and the packer never overlaps two tiles, so rows are patched in place
    // rather than moved - the minimum churn that still expresses the edit. Nothing
    // downstream may assume row order IS tile order; see `targetAt`.
    //
    // The model is also where a tile's LIFETIME lives, which is what lets a removed
    // tile fade instead of blinking out: `dying` keeps the row - and therefore the
    // delegate - alive past the packing that dropped it, and `entering` marks a row
    // the page grew after it was seeded. Both are properties of the ROW (a removed
    // tile is exactly "a row that is no longer in the packing"), so neither is a mode
    // flag that can drift out of sync with what is on screen.
    ListModel { id: placementModel }

    // Which page the model currently holds rows FOR - null until the first sync.
    //
    // This is the clone's own problem, and the reason it needs no `_live` flag. The
    // hub gives each page its own delegate, so a page can only ever be BORN or edited.
    // The Manager has ONE clone and moves `pageIndex` (Manager.qml binds it to
    // currentPageIndex), so every tile on screen changes at once when the user clicks
    // another page in the sidebar. That is not an edit: nothing was added and nothing
    // was removed - the user asked to look somewhere else. Read as an edit it would be
    // the worst frame in the app: every tile of the old page fading out as a ghost
    // while every tile of the new one faded in through them.
    //
    // So a page switch RE-SEEDS: rows are dropped outright and re-appended inert. It
    // doubles as the hub's `_live` - nothing has been seeded yet at construction, so
    // the first sync is a re-seed and the tiles the clone opens with never fade in.
