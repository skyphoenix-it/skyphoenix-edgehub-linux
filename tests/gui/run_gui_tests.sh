# Visible GUI test runner for the EdgeHub Hub + Manager.
#
# Runs every tests/gui/tst_gui_*.qml in a REAL, nested KWin compositor (the same
# compositor as the device) via qmltestrunner under QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland, at a
# watchable speed (-mousedelay/-keydelay). Each test captures grabImage() PNG
# evidence into gui-evidence/. A per-run video is stitched from the frames.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/gui/run_gui_tests.sh [--visible] [--fast] [--record] [-jN] [pattern]
#     --visible  : run the nested compositor in WINDOWED mode, so the whole suite
#                  is VISIBLE on your desktop and you can watch every click.
#                  Implies -j1 (one window to watch) and keeps the watchable
#                  input speed. WITHOUT this flag the compositor uses
#                  `--virtual`, which renders to an off-screen framebuffer - the
#                  tests are just as real, but you cannot see them. That
#                  distinction cost a review cycle; hence the flag.
#     --fast     : mousedelay 0 (confirmation re-runs); default is visible speed
#     --record   : also ffmpeg-record each file's bounded nested XWayland display
#                  (implies -j1 for a watchable ordered capture)
#     -jN        : run N files concurrently, each in its OWN nested KWin
#                  (default 1). The suite is ~1000 test functions and takes
#                  hours sequentially; -j8 brings it under half an hour. Files
#                  are independent processes over independent stores, and each
#                  file's evidence PNGs carry a per-file prefix, so they do not
#                  collide. Use -j1 when you want to watch (or record) a run.
