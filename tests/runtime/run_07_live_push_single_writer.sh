# Scenario 07 - the single-writer rule (B5): a connected hub OWNS config.toml.
#
# The two-writer save race was real: the Manager used to atomically rename
# config.toml while the hub's own writer was doing the same, and an edit could
# vanish. The fix (manager/src/manager_backend.h saveUiState) makes the Manager
# PUSH over the control socket when connected and let the HUB persist. The
# Manager half of that rule has unit coverage (tests/cpp/tst_manager_backend_sync.cpp,
# livePushOnSave, against a FakeHub); the HUB half - that the real hub actually
# applies AND durably persists what is pushed to it - had none, so the contract
# the fix leans on was never proven end-to-end against the real binary.
#
# One hub, driven over its REAL control socket by ipc_client.py (the protocol
# the Manager speaks; see that file for why a stand-in and not the GUI binary):
#
#   1. getUiState        - the hub serves its live state: the SEEDED layout.
#                          (Control: proves the socket + read channel work, so a
#                          later "the state changed" is a real change.)
#   2. setUiState B      - ack "ok", and config.toml holds B *immediately*: the
#                          hub is the writer, and the ack is the save receipt
#                          (applyExternalUiState saves BEFORE the ack - an
#                          explicit Qt::DirectConnection, app/src/main.cpp).
#   3. setUiState ""     - rejected with an error ack, and config.toml is
#                          byte-identical: a rejected push writes NOTHING. Only
#                          meaningful next to step 2, which proves an accepted
#                          push on this same socket DOES write.
#   4. RESTART           - the pushed layout is what loads: the hub's write was
#                          durable, not just an in-memory apply.
#
# Honest limit: this proves the hub keeps its half (it owns and performs the
# write). It does NOT re-prove the Manager's half (that it must not rename
# config.toml while connected) - the Manager exposes no headless save hook, and
# adding one would be product code written for a test. That half stays with the
# FakeHub unit test named above.
