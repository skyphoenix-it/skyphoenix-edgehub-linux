# Scenario 06 — --reset vs --reset-wizard: the destructive/non-destructive pair.
#
# These two flags are one keystroke apart and documented one line apart
# (AGENTS.md: "--reset flag loads fresh defaults; --reset-wizard re-triggers the
# first-run wizard"). What separates them is the user's whole layout, and no
# test held that line: --reset MUST discard the config, --reset-wizard MUST show
# the wizard while keeping every tile the user built.
#
# Three launches over the same seed (an httpjson tile polling a loopback sink):
#
#   1. CONTROL (no flag)  — the sink IS hit and config.toml survives. Establishes
#      the observation channel; the zeros below are meaningful only because the
#      same seed demonstrably produces hits without a flag.
#   2. --reset-wizard     — ZERO sink hits (the wizard is up: main.qml's StackView
#      takes `initialItem: isFirstRun ? FirstRunWizard : Dashboard`, so the
#      Dashboard — and the user's polling tile with it — is never instantiated)
#      AND config.toml is byte-identical, first_run_complete still true. The
#      wizard re-triggers for the SESSION without touching the user's file.
#   3. --reset            — config.toml is gone and the user's layout with it;
#      a relaunch comes up on defaults, not on the seeded page.
#
# The wizard is observed BEHAVIORALLY (the user's tile does not run), not by
# pixels — the same technique scenario 02 uses for a forced preset, and the only
# one available: QML console.log is filtered out of the product log.
#
# NOT asserted, deliberately: that --reset leaves no backup. It does not (unlike
# the corruption path, which preserves a .corrupt-*.bak — see scenario 05), but
# pinning that here would make a future "back up before reset" improvement fail
# a test whose subject is the flag contract. Reported in the W4 findings instead.
