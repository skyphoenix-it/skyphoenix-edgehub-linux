"""E18 secret-detection predicate regressions.

E18 flags tracked files that look like committed secrets. Its directory rule was
once unanchored (`"/secrets/" in f`), which also matched any SOURCE package
directory named `secrets` at any depth — an adopter with a
`com/skyphoenix/platform/secrets/**` Java module saw 9 ordinary source files
reported as tracked secrets, failing E18 and turning its gate red.

These tests pin both halves of the fix: source packages must not be flagged, and
genuine secrets must still be caught regardless of nesting depth.
