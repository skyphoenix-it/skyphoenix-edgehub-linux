"""e2e_buildup.py - incremental build-up scenario on the REAL Edge panel.

Owner-requested (2026-07-19): strip the dashboard to nothing, then add things
back ONE AT A TIME, checking the real hub on the real panel after every single
step. Screens, then widgets, then themes, then accents, then animated
backgrounds, then wallpapers, then orientation.

Why this exists, in test terms: it is the first coverage of the REAL hub binary
being driven incrementally over the REAL control socket, with the rendered panel
checked after each mutation. Everything else either drives a stub (the GUI
suite's ManagerHarness), or asserts store facts with nothing rendered
(tests/runtime), or changes many things at once. A build-up is what catches
"step 7 is fine alone but breaks after step 6" - coherence, not units.

Every step does three things:
  1. push ONE change over IPC,
  2. read the state back and assert the hub actually took it,
  3. grab the Edge rect to a PNG so a human can flip through the sequence.

Grabs are cropped to the Edge rect by the harness, so no other monitor is
captured.

The hub runs with an isolated XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, so the live
hub's config, single-instance lock and control socket are never touched.

Run:
    python3 tests/hardware/e2e_buildup.py                  # IPC + grabs
    XENEON_HW_INPUT=1 python3 tests/hardware/e2e_buildup.py  # + real touch

Output: /tmp/edge-buildup-<n>/NNN-<step>.png, one frame per step, in order.
