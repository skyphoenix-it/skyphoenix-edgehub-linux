"""widget_render_matrix.py - every widget type actually RENDERS on the real Edge.

The biggest remaining coverage gap. The offscreen suites prove each widget's
LOGIC and config; e2e_buildup proves that *something* renders. Nothing proved
that each of the 30 widget types individually draws correctly on the panel -
so a widget that silently fell back to "This widget isn't available", or drew
nothing at all, would pass every existing test.

For each widget type this puts it ALONE on the visible page, grabs the Edge, and
asserts two things:

  1. RENDERED - the frame differs from an empty-page baseline. Catches a widget
     that draws nothing.
  2. DISTINCT - no two widget types produce the same frame. This is what catches
     the fallback tile: a broken widget renders the SAME "isn't available" card
     regardless of type, so two broken widgets collide. It also catches a widget
     that renders as an empty card.

Both together are hard to satisfy accidentally: a widget must draw, and draw
something of its own.
