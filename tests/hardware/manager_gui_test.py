"""manager_gui_test.py — drive the REAL Manager on the REAL desktop, with real
synthetic input, and verify the effect reaches the REAL hub on the Edge.

This closes the largest coverage gap in the repo. Until now:
  * tests/gui/ drives Manager.qml with the C++ backend STUBBED
    (ManagerHarness.qml: screensJson()="[]", metricsJson()="{}"), inside a
    nested compositor. It is not the Manager as shipped.
  * tests/hardware/edge_e2e.py runs the Manager as
    `timeout -s KILL 10 MANAGER` — launch, screenshot, kill. Zero interaction.
  * Nothing anywhere connects the real Manager binary to the real hub binary.

So: real Manager, real hub, real clicks, real socket, real panel.

SAFETY — what stops this clicking somewhere it should not
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Owner constraint (2026-07-19): "I approve that my cursor moves around, as long
as the clicks and so on are focused on the applications that are actually being
tested."

  1. SEPARATE GATE — XENEON_HW_INPUT_DESKTOP=1. The Edge gate alone does not
     enable this; the cursor never leaves the Edge without this second opt-in.
  2. WINDOW-PRECISE CLAMP — every event is clamped to the Manager's OWN window
     rect, parsed from the rect the Manager logs at placement
     (manager/src/main.cpp). Not the monitor: on a 5120x1440 screen "confined to
     the monitor" would still allow clicking whatever else is open there.
  3. CONTAINMENT CHECK — the parsed rect must lie inside a real non-Edge screen,
     or we refuse to inject (a stale/bogus rect must never become a click).
  4. RENDER PROBE — the rect must visibly change when the Manager changes state,
     proving the window is actually there, before the first event is emitted.
  5. KILL SWITCH — input_guard aborts injection for the rest of the run on ANY
     real input from the owner. Watch, do not touch.
  6. The hub runs with an isolated XDG_CONFIG_HOME/XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, so the live
     hub's config and socket are untouched. The MANAGER, however, is the real
     binary against that same isolated config — that is the point.

        Manager's window RECT. It does NOT establish that the Manager is the
        window RECEIVING events there. On this box the owner's browser was
        stacked above the Manager on DP-2, so all five sidebar clicks went into
        a documentation page: four checks failed as "the click did not change
        tabs", the frames were byte-identical because the browser never moved,
        and the run reported Manager bugs that did not exist. Worse than the
        false result, we injected six clicks into an unrelated application.

        `manager-rect-verified` could not catch this — it only asserts the rect
        lies on a real non-Edge screen. A stale-but-plausible rect, an occluded
        window and a correct one all look identical to it.

        The technique is the one e2e_harness already uses for the Edge: change
        the app's state from OUTSIDE and require the pixels to move. The Manager
        is live-connected to the hub, so pushing an appearance change through
        the hub repaints its Edge preview. If those pixels do not move, either
        the Manager is occluded, or it is not connected, or it is not rendering
