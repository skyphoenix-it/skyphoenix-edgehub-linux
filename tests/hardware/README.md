# Real-hardware tests (Xeneon Edge)

Headless end-to-end tests that run against the **actual Edge panel** — interaction
(synthetic touch), live IPC, performance, and stability. Complements the offscreen
`tests/ui` qmltest suite, which can't exercise the real compositor, touch input, or
the C++ backend on-device.

## Synthetic-input safety (READ THIS FIRST)

These suites can emit **real input events into a live desktop session**. That
is never allowed to be a surprise side effect of "run the tests", and it is
structurally impossible for events to land outside the Edge:

1. **Opt-in gate** — all synthetic input is **SKIPPED unless
   `XENEON_HW_INPUT=1`** is explicitly set. Without it, `edge_e2e.py` runs
   everything IPC/grab-driven and loudly skips the interaction suite;
   creating a real uinput device raises `InputGateError` before the device
   node is even opened. (`edge_hw_test.py`, the deprecated legacy script,
   additionally requires `XENEON_HW_LEGACY=1`.)
2. **Confinement to the Edge rect, at the event-synthesis layer** —
   preferred injector is `VTouch`, a true multitouch (ABS_MT) touchscreen
   that KWin **physically maps to the Edge output** (the writable
   `org.kde.KWin.InputDevice.outputName` DBus property, readback-verified;
   the Edge's own "wch.cn TouchScreen" is mapped the same way). Its events
   *cannot* land on another monitor. The fallback `VPointer` clamps every
   coordinate to the Edge rect inside the single emit path — there is no
   unclamped API. Both are unit-tested via a capture sink
   (`test_input_safety.py`) without injecting anything.
3. **Target-window verification before the first event** — the harness
   render-probes the hub (two opposite wallpaper states must show up in
   grabs of exactly the Edge rect) and then requires an **IPC-verified
   landing probe** (a tapped hydration counter must actually increment).
   No verification → no injection, loud skip.
4. **User-activity kill switch** — a pure-python Wayland
   `ext-idle-notify-v1` monitor (`input_guard.py`; `/dev/input` is not
   readable by regular users here) watches for REAL input-device activity.
   Injection never starts until the owner has been hands-off for
   `XENEON_HW_IDLE_SECONDS` (default **3 s** — longer than any intra-burst
   typing/mousing gap, short enough not to stall the suite), and any real
   event mid-run raises `UserActivityAbort` and disables injection for the
   rest of the run. Known limit: an event landing within ~150 ms right
   after one of our own writes is masked until the next idle cycle
   (~100 ms) — the per-event abort checks keep that exposure well under a
   second.
5. **Stale-geometry defense** — `XENEON_EDGE_GEOM`/`XENEON_CANVAS`
   overrides are cross-checked against live `kscreen-doctor` output and
   **rejected** on mismatch (only `XENEON_GEOM_TRUST=1` skips the check,
   for non-KDE setups).

Measured on this box (2026-07-16, KWin 6.7.3): the VTouch axis transform is
`rot270` — KWin scales the MT device in the panel's native landscape axes
and then applies DP-3's 270° output transform; the harness probes this per
run, so it is measured, never assumed. Side effect to know about: KWin
persists the device→output binding in `~/.config/kcminputrc` as
`[Libinput][4660][22136][xeneon-virt-touch] OutputUuid=…` — scoped to the
virtual device's vendor/product/name, inert for every real device, and it
makes the mapping automatic on future runs.

Unit tests for all of the above (no injection, no compositor traffic):

```sh
python3 tests/hardware/test_input_safety.py
```

## Requirements

- The Edge connected and enabled (normally DP-3). The hub auto-detects it.
- A release build: `./scripts/build.sh release` (produces `build/xeneon-edge-hub`).
- `/dev/uinput` writable by your user — for synthetic touch. On this box the
  openlinkhub/Corsair daemon grants it via an ACL (`getfacl /dev/uinput` should show
  `user:<you>:rw-`). Otherwise add yourself to the `input` group.
- `python3` with `PIL` (Pillow) only if you want screenshots; the test itself needs
  no third-party packages. `kscreen-doctor` (KDE) is used to auto-detect geometry;
  override with `XENEON_EDGE_GEOM="x,y,w,h"` and `XENEON_CANVAS="w,h"` on other setups.
- For `edge_hw_test.py`: no hub already running (that older script still uses
  the real config + runtime dir). `edge_e2e.py` isolates both, so a live hub is
  no longer stranded or required to be stopped — but both hubs will fight over
  the Edge panel visually, so stopping the live one is still *recommended* for
  clean grabs.

## Run

```sh
XENEON_HW_INPUT=1 python3 tests/hardware/edge_e2e.py        # the current suite

# legacy, DEPRECATED (real config + runtime dir; double opt-in required):
XENEON_HW_INPUT=1 XENEON_HW_LEGACY=1 python3 tests/hardware/edge_hw_test.py
```

`edge_hw_test.py` **backs up and restores** `~/.config/xeneon-edge-hub/config.toml`
(a live `setUiState` persists to disk), so your layout/appearance is untouched.
Without both env vars it prints a deprecation banner and exits 2.

## What it covers (`edge_hw_test.py`, legacy)

- **Launch/placement** on the Edge + control socket comes up.
- **IPC**: `ping`, 300 `getUiState` round-trips (latency p50/p99), 25 concurrent
  connections, 500 connect/disconnect cycles — no drops.
- **Robustness**: malformed JSON, a >8 MB oversized message, and a partial message
  are all handled without crashing the hub.
- **Synthetic touch** (real events via a pure-python uinput virtual pointer): opens a
  tile's expanded overlay, taps the Focus preset segments and **verifies via
  `getUiState` that `cfg.preset` changed** (skipped if page 0 has no Focus tile),
  closes via the Done bar, swipes between pages, and runs a 40-tap storm.
- **Stability/perf**: no fd/thread leak, RSS reported, clean shutdown (exit 0).

## Files

- `uinput_touch.py` — reusable pure-python synthetic touch/pointer (no sudo, no
  ydotool), gated + confined as described above. `VTouch` (ABS_MT, output-bound)
  + `VPointer` (clamped) + `detect_edge_ex()`. See its header for the two Wayland
  gotchas (24-byte `input_event` packing; the move→settle→click sequence).
- `input_guard.py` — the user-activity kill switch (Wayland ext-idle-notify-v1).
- `test_input_safety.py` — injection-free unit tests for gate/clamp/kill switch/
  geometry.
- `edge_hw_test.py` — the consolidated legacy test above (DEPRECATED — prefer
  `edge_e2e.py`).

## Not covered (needs a human)

- **Physical rotation → auto-rotate**: the sensor is read from `/dev/hidraw5` and the
  pipeline is wired + debounced, but only a person can physically turn the panel.
- Subjective feel (animation smoothness, readability at arm's length).

## `edge_e2e.py` — comprehensive E2E suite (hub + Manager)

The big one. Drives the **real hub on the Edge** and the **Manager**, covering
"everything", and reports a single pass/fail. Uses an **isolated
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`** *and* an **isolated `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`** per spawned hub, so
the live config, the single-instance lock and the control socket of a running
hub are never touched — no backup/restore needed, and the suite can no longer
strand a live hub's Manager connection.

### How the runtime-dir isolation works (and why)

The hub binds `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/xeneon-edge-hub-ctl`
(`app/src/control_socket_path.h`). The harness used to keep the REAL
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` because Wayland's compositor socket lives there — which
meant the spawned hub bound the REAL control socket, and the harness cleanup
`os.remove()`d it, silently stranding any live hub (it keeps its listening fd,
so it *looks* healthy while the Manager can never reach it again).

`e2e_harness.E2E` now gives every spawned hub:

- a private, short (`sockaddr_un` ≈107-byte cap), 0700 `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
  (`self.run_dir`), where its control socket (`self.sock`) and lock land;
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` rewritten to an **absolute path** into the real runtime
  dir — Wayland resolves an absolute `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` without consulting
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so the hub still reaches the compositor and renders on
  the Edge. Verified on the real session: absolute path → renders
  (grab-confirmed) with its socket in the isolated dir; relative name under
  the same isolation → cannot connect to the compositor;
- a **removal guard**: cleanup refuses to delete any socket outside its own
  private runtime dir, so no code path can unlink a live hub's socket;
- `cleanup()` (stop + remove the private dir) — `edge_e2e.py` calls it.

There is no module-level `SOCK` any more, on purpose: anything still
importing it operated on the live hub's socket and should break loudly.
Use `h.sock`. (`edge_hw_test.py`, the older standalone script, still runs
against the real config/runtime dir with its own backup/restore — don't run
it against a session with a hub you care about; `edge_e2e.py` is the safe,
current suite.)

```sh
python3 tests/hardware/edge_e2e.py                 # full run (~20–30 min)
E2E_SOAK_SECONDS=5 python3 tests/hardware/edge_e2e.py   # quick smoke (~2 min)
```

**Coverage (~199 checks):**
- **Widget lifecycle** — add / render / no-error / resize (1↔2) / remove for **every
  type in `WidgetCatalog.qml`** (30 today) via IPC `setUiState`/`getUiState` + Edge
  screenshots. The list is asserted against the catalog first, so a new widget can't
  go silently unexercised. `httpjson` is seeded with **no URL** (the shipping preset
  state, and it keeps the run offline); `kpi` uses its **local-file** source.
- **Theming** — every theme (29: 21 classics + 7 distro palettes + default dark),
  every background style (11, incl. the arch/fedora/aubergine character styles),
  per-widget accent override, glass/glow, each verified in state + grabbed. The
  `THEMES`/`BG_STYLES` lists are drift-checked against `ui/qml/Theme.qml` and
  `ui/qml/BackgroundCatalog.qml` first (same contract as the widget list), and the
  soak rotation reuses them, so a new theme or style can't go silently unexercised.
- **Interaction (synthetic touch)** — compact widget controls (Focus Start/Pause,
  Hydration ±, Task toggle) verified over IPC; **page-swipe navigation** verified
  by distinct per-page wallpapers (average-colour distance). **Opt-in only**
  (`XENEON_HW_INPUT=1`) and preceded by window verification + landing probe +
  kill-switch arming — see "Synthetic-input safety" above. Skipped loudly
  otherwise; the soak's periodic swipes obey the same gate.
- **IPC** — malformed/partial/oversized input (no crash), latency p50/p99 over 200
  round-trips, 20 concurrent connections.
- **Soak** — sustained **mixed** operations (add/remove/resize/theme/background/
  multi-page + periodic swipes) for `E2E_SOAK_SECONDS` (default 1200 → ~20 min);
  the bulk of the runtime and the real stability signal.
- **Manager** — Dark / Light / Default chrome all render with 0 QML errors.

Modules: `e2e_harness.py` (launch/IPC/touch/grab primitives), `e2e_widgets.py`,
`e2e_theming.py`, `e2e_interaction.py`, orchestrated by `edge_e2e.py`.

The Manager's **drag-reorder** logic (incl. the "name-tag stuck in air" regression)
is covered deterministically offscreen by `tests/ui/tst_edgeclone_drag.qml`.
