"""manager_reflection_test.py — HUB -> Manager reflection (the other direction).

manager_hub_boundary tests Manager -> hub (clicks in the Manager land on the
hub). This tests the reverse: a change made on the HUB must appear in the
Manager, because the Manager polls the hub every 4s (manager_backend.h, the
`pull` timer) and mirrors it.

Covers three reflections, each: change it on the hub over the control socket,
wait for the Manager to pull, grab the Manager, assert it changed.

  1. SCREENS    — add screens on the hub -> the Manager's screen chips grow.
  2. THEME      — change the theme on the hub -> the Manager preview recolours.
  3. ORIENTATION — set the hub to landscape -> the Manager PREVIEW becomes WIDE.

(3) is a KNOWN BUG the owner reported: hub horizontal shown vertical in the
Manager. The hub reports the raw SENSOR rotation (-1 with no sensor) rather than
its effective CONTENT rotation, and with no sensor the hub DEFAULTS to landscape
(main.qml contentRotation) — so the panel is landscape while the Manager, in
auto, is told "unknown" and falls back to portrait. This test is written to FAIL
until the hub reports effective rotation.

This direction is deliberately input-free: the Manager starts on the Screens
tab, so clicking that already-selected tab adds risk without adding coverage.
Before inspecting it, the suite grabs the real desktop and proves the real
Manager is frontmost in its own logged window rect and that Screens is selected.
