## UC-01: First-Run Setup and Display Selection

**Actor:** Any user (first launch)
**Priority:** Critical (P0)
**Precondition:** Application installed, at least two displays connected (one is Xeneon Edge).

### Main Flow
1. User launches the application for the first time.
2. Application detects all connected displays.
3. Application presents a first-run wizard showing each display with:
   - Name (e.g., "Corsair Xeneon Edge")
   - Manufacturer and model (from EDID)
   - Connector (e.g., "DP-1", "HDMI-1")
   - Physical size (if available from EDID)
   - Resolution (e.g., "2560×720")
   - Scale factor
   - Current orientation
   - Refresh rate
4. Application highlights displays matching the Xeneon Edge profile (2560×720 or 720×2560, Corsair EDID).
5. User selects the dashboard display.
6. User chooses starter layout (productivity, gaming, minimal, or blank).
7. User optionally enables autostart.
8. User optionally enables automatic reconnection after display plug/unplug.
9. Application stores display identity using EDID hash + connector fallback.
10. Application opens the dashboard on the selected display.

### Alternate Flows
- **A1: Only one display detected** - warn user, still allow selection, suggest connecting secondary display.
- **A2: No Xeneon-like display detected** - show all displays, let user manually select.
- **A3: User skips wizard** - open on primary display in windowed mode, show setup reminder.
- **A4: Touchscreen not detected** - warn that touch input may not work, proceed anyway.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Wizard is fully usable via touch.
- Display information is accurate and readable.
- Wizard can be reopened from settings.
- Selection persists across application restarts.
