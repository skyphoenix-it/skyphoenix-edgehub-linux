# Xeneon Edge — Development & Test Plan (Hub + Manager)

**Status:** Historical execution plan · **Created:** 2026-07-13 · **Owner:** engineering
**Goal at creation:** finish debugging the hub and manager, then bring the project
to a verifiable **≥95% aggregate coverage gate**.

> **Superseded as a current status document.** The baseline, waves, counts and
> results below are a point-in-time engineering record. They must not be used as
> evidence for the current candidate. Use
> [MVP scope and evidence status](product/mvp-scope.md) for current requirements,
> [the strict release gate](testing/release-gate.md) for the executable manifest,
> and `scripts/run_all_tests.sh` for the current development aggregate.

## Historical context — why this plan existed

At the 2026-07-13 baseline, the hub (`xeneon-edge-hub`) and companion
(`xeneon-edge-manager`) had received a large bug-fix sweep, but four gaps remained.
The present-tense statements below describe that old baseline and were later
resolved; the historical fix plan is preserved in `docs/BUG_FIX_PLAN.md`.

1. **The C++ layer has zero automated tests.** `control_server`, `orientation_sensor`,
   `ManagerBackend`, `ConfigBridge`, `mpris_bridge` — including the IPC protocol, the
   reconnect/reconcile state machine, path-sanitization, and orientation mapping — are
   only exercised indirectly by the on-device Python E2E script.
2. **Coverage is not measured anywhere.** `.gitignore` has `lcov.info`/`*.profdata`
   placeholders but nothing generates them. There is no numeric gate.
3. **CI never runs.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggers on `main`; the repo lives on
   `master`. It also has no QML-test job, no C++ job, and no coverage step.
4. **`BUG_FIX_PLAN.md` has no authoritative done-list** — several systemic (S1–S12) and
   HIGH findings need re-verification against current code.

Baseline (verified 2026-07-13):

| Layer | Tests today | Coverage measured | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rust `core/` | 63 inline (`config` 11, `display` 15, `ffi` 14, `metrics` 23) | none | `logging.rs` untested; not all 54 FFI fns direct-tested |
| QML `ui/` + `manager/` | 45 `tst_*.qml`, ~832 fns | none | orchestrators, Manager, EdgeClone, several primitives, backgrounds, wizard, diagnostics untested |
| C++ `app/` + `manager/` | **0** | none | entire layer |

### Decisions locked with the user (2026-07-13)

- **QML coverage = behavior/function traceability matrix** (there is no trustworthy QML
  line-coverage tool). True line coverage is gated only on Rust + C++.
- **C++ becomes testable via header extraction** — pull the logic classes out of the
  `main.cpp` TUs into headers/free functions.
- **Deps approved:** QtTest (bundled), `cargo-llvm-cov`, `proptest` (Rust dev-dep).
  A fake `libxeneon_core` was **not** chosen — C++ tests link the **real**
  `libxeneon_core.a` against a temp `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (the Rust config honors it).
- **Debug scope = full re-verification** of S1–S12 + all HIGH findings, each fix gated by
  a regression test.

---

## What "95%" means per layer (honest)

- **Rust:** true LLVM source-based **line coverage**, gated ≥95% via `cargo llvm-cov` JSON.
- **C++:** true **line coverage** (gcov/gcovr) over the *testable units* (extracted
  headers/free functions + `control_server.cpp`), gated ≥95%. Un-unit-testable glue
  (`main()`, live-`QScreen` matching, hardware ioctl loops, D-Bus fan-out) is **excluded
  from the denominator** and covered instead by offscreen smoke + the hardware E2E.
- **QML:** **behavior-matrix** coverage — enumerated behaviors covered ÷ total 100%,
  enforced by `scripts/qml_coverage.py`. Not presented as line coverage.
- **Genuinely unmeasurable (assert driving props, never output):** Canvas pixels
  (Sparkline/RingProgress/AnalogClock/Net/backgrounds), `MultiEffect` (AppIcon), real
  hardware (EDID/sensors), live network (Open-Meteo/geocode → FakeXHR + fixtures), MPRIS
  D-Bus (→ MockMedia).

---

## Part 1 — Finish the debugging sweep (full S1–S12 + HIGH re-verification)

Each item is **verified against current code**; if still open, fixed and gated by a
regression test (Rust `#[test]`, C++ QtTest, or QML `tst_`).

### C++ bugs to fix + pin (from the C++ audit)
- **Hub `XENEON_GRAB` UAF** — `app/src/main.cpp:714` lambda captures `&grabPath` by
  reference into a 2200 ms deferred `singleShot` (manager captures by value at `:497`).
  → capture by value. Regression = `smoke_hub` (ASan).
- **`metricsToJson` data race** — `main.cpp:77` `static bool warned` read/written from
  GUI thread (`:514`) and worker thread (`:104`). → `std::atomic<bool>`.
- **Hub `applyAutostart` optimistic return** — `main.cpp:271-273` disable path returns
  `true` even if `QFile::remove` fails (manager is honest at `:441-445`). → return real
  result. Regression in `tst_autostart`.
- **control_server honest-ack** (`control_server.cpp:120-129`) — verify the ack reflects
  `uiStateReceived`'s out-param; pin with `tst_control_server`.
- **Manager reconnect PULL-before-PUSH** ordering — pin via `tst_reconcile` +
  `tst_manager_backend_sync`.
- **EDID identity-hash duplication** — `main.cpp:158-166` vs `:206-214`; extract
  `screenIdentityHash(...)` and pin.

### Rust bugs (from `BUG_FIX_PLAN.md` §Rust core — verify each still open)
- `metrics.rs:44` `OnceLock` sensor/GPU path cache → permanent "unavailable" after a
  transient boot-time miss. Fix: bounded re-discovery when `None`.
- `metrics.rs:38` shared CPU/net delta baseline across GUI + worker → spurious spikes.
- `config.rs:179` corrupt-config full reset drops `ui_state`/overwrites `.bak`. Fix:
  timestamped backups, preserve `first_run_complete`/`ui_state` where possible.
- `ffi.rs:538` `-1.0` temp sentinel collides with real sub-zero readings.
- `display.rs:19` `parse_manufacturer` emits non-alpha garbage on zero group.
  (These already have `bug_*` encoding tests — flip them to passing.)

### Remaining items from `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`
- **S10** write-only FFI keys (`reconnect`, `notify_disconnect`, `fallback_behavior`) —
  wire the existing getters into hub behavior (disconnect handling).
- **Two-writer save race** — move to single-writer (hub owns file; Manager mutates via
  IPC only) or document as accepted.
- **Duplicate "Page 5" pages** — one-time prune in live config.

### QML systemic (S1–S12) — confirm each resolved with a `tst_` gate
Walk S1 (effAccent loop), S2 (control-binding self-destruct), S3 (`active`), S4 (metric
availability), S5 (shared history/peaks), S6 (DST day math), S7 (effAccent content),
S8 (settingsFor mutation), S9 (hotplug), S10, S11 (structureRevision), S12 (text overflow)
against current source; each must have at least one asserting test.

---

## Part 2 — C++ test harness (enabling refactor + QtTest)

### 2a. Enabling refactor (straight cut-paste into headers; AUTOMOC-safe)
New headers/free functions (production + tests compile identical code):
- `app/src/config_bridge.h` — `ConfigBridge`, `WizardBridge`.
- `app/src/autostart.{h,cpp}` — `applyAutostart` (temp-HOME testable; honest return).
- `app/src/display_match.{h,cpp}` — `screenIdentityHash(...)`, `orientationName(...)`,
  `metricsToJson()` (atomic warn). `findTargetScreen`/`screenToJson` stay in `main.cpp`
  (live `QScreen`) but delegate to `screenIdentityHash`.
- `app/src/metrics_worker.h` — `MetricsWorker`.
- `manager/src/manager_backend.h` — `ManagerBackend` (+ injectable clock, see below).
- `manager/src/reconcile.{h,cpp}` — pure `reconcileOnPull(pendingPush, nowMs,
  suppressUntilMs, pulled, lastHub, pendingPush) -> ReconcileAction`.
- `manager/src/path_sanitize.h` — `sanitizeImageName(name, imagesDir) -> optional<QString>`.
- `app/src/orientation_sensor.h` — make `byteToRotation` **public static**.
- **Injectable clock:** `ManagerBackend` gets `std::function<qint64()> m_nowMs` (default
  `QDateTime::currentMSecsSinceEpoch`) + `setClockForTest(...)`, replacing the 5 direct
  clock calls (`manager/src/main.cpp:112,121,381,411,422`) so the 1500 ms/900 ms
  suppression windows are testable with zero real waiting.

### 2b. Framework & build
- **QtTest** (`QTEST_GUILESS_MAIN` for logic/IPC, `QTEST_MAIN` only where a
  `QGuiApplication` is needed), all under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`.
- CMake: `option(XENEON_BUILD_TESTS OFF)`, `option(XENEON_COVERAGE OFF)`;
  `tests/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` with an `add_qt_test(...)` helper, per-test executables,
  `enable_testing()`, `add_test`, per-test `ENVIRONMENT` (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`,
  temp `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`). Run: `ctest --test-dir build`.
- C++ tests link the **real** `libxeneon_core.a`; each test uses a fresh temp
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` so config round-trips are hermetic.

### 2c. Test files (under `tests/cpp/`)
- **Unit (pure):** `tst_display_match`, `tst_metrics_json`, `tst_path_sanitize`
  (traversal matrix: `../`, absolute, `a/b`, `.`/`..`, empty, spaces/`#`),
  `tst_orientation_byte` (0x03→0/0x00→270/0x01→180/0x02→90/else→-1), `tst_reconcile`
  (decision table), `tst_autostart`.
- **Unit (event loop):** `tst_config_bridge`, `tst_metrics_worker` (QThread + QSignalSpy,
  clean teardown).
- **Integration (real QLocalSocket):** `tst_control_server` (ping/getUiState/setUiState
  ok+fail-ack/empty/malformed/unknown/shutdown-order/8 MiB cap/re-entrancy),
  `tst_manager_backend_sync` (PULL-before-PUSH, KeepAndPush/DropEdit/Adopt, suppression
  window via injected clock, deleteImage/importImage).
- **Smoke (real binaries, offscreen):** `smoke_hub` / `smoke_manager` via `XENEON_GRAB`
  → assert exit 0 + non-empty PNG (covers `main()`, screen matching, thread lifecycle;
  doubles as UAF regression; optionally under ASan/UBSan).
- **Headless negative:** `tst_orientation_reopen` (FIFO/closed fd → EOF/EAGAIN/error →
  retry-timer path, no hardware).
- **Coverage:** `-DXENEON_COVERAGE=ON` adds `--coverage`; `gcovr --filter app/src/
  --filter manager/src/ --exclude '.*main\.cpp' --fail-under-line 95` → `coverage/cpp-lcov.info`.

---

## Part 3 — Rust tests to ≥95%

- **Tool:** `cargo-llvm-cov` (LLVM source-based; accurate across `extern "C"`/`unsafe`).
  `cargo llvm-cov --lib --lcov --output-path coverage/rust-lcov.info` +
  `--json --summary-only` for the gate (`totals.lines.percent >= 95`).
- **`logging.rs`:** extract `fn level_filter(&str) -> LevelFilter`, unit-test the mapping;
  drive `init_logging` for each level + idempotency.
- **`ffi.rs`:** for all 54 `extern "C"` fns — null-pointer sentinel branch each;
  setter↔getter round-trips through `CString` (+ `xeneon_string_free`); handle lifecycle;
  invalid-UTF-8 input must not panic across the ABI; `xeneon_string_free(null)` no-op.
- **`proptest`** (`[dev-dependencies] proptest = "1"`): `compute_edid_hash`/`parse_*` on
  arbitrary bytes (no panic, bounded, deterministic); `Config` serde round-trip;
  `metrics` JSON round-trip + numeric clamps.

---

## Part 4 — QML tests to 100% behavior matrix

New `tst_*.qml` (pattern: `import QtTest` + `WidgetHarness`, `findPred` tree helpers,
`tick`/store-epoch for time, props-not-pixels for Canvas):

- Orchestrators: `tst_dashboard.qml` (cfgAction/closeExpanded/applyExternalState/
  _tileExists/applyAppearance/injectWidget + 7 appearance→store Connections),
  `tst_main.qml` (bindStackItem + content rotation 0/90/180/270).
- Manager: `tst_manager.qml` (4 tabs, pageTiles/refreshImages/confirmDeleteImage/
  syncTheme, MButton/MSwitch — stubbed `backend`), `tst_edgeclone.qml`
  (wsrc/spanH/injectInto/targetAt + resize-drag).
- Primitives: `tst_sparkline`, `tst_ringprogress`, `tst_widgetchrome`,
  `tst_settings_panel`, `tst_widget_config_panel`, `tst_controls`
  (PillButton/SegmentedControl), `tst_appicon` (fallback props only).
- Backgrounds: `tst_backgrounds_components` (each of 7: `active`/`running` static-vs-
  animated + reduceMotion forces static).
- Catalogs/theme: `tst_widget_catalog`, `tst_theme`, `tst_catalogs`.
- Screens: `tst_diagnostics`, `tst_first_run_wizard`.
- Store IO: `tst_store_io` (`_persistableData` strips `hist`/`peakRx`/`peakTx`,
  `_isEphemeralKey`, `_hasBridge`, `flushNow` via injected fake `configBridge` spy).
- Network: `tst_weather_net`, `tst_calendar_net` using the **XHR factory seam**.

**XHR factory seam (small production change):** add `property var xhrFactory: null` to
`WeatherWidget.qml`, `CalendarWidget.qml`, and `manager/qml/WidgetConfigDialog.qml`;
`var xhr = w.xhrFactory ? w.xhrFactory() : new XMLHttpRequest()`. Tests inject a FakeXHR
+ fixtures (valid forecast/geocode + failure shapes: non-200, missing fields, malformed
JSON, empty results, timeout).

**Matrix enforcement:** `scripts/qml_coverage.py` enumerates behaviors from source
(functions, schema keys, control ids, catalog lengths) and covered behaviors from `tst_`
files (each declares a `// COVERS:` header cross-checked against real assertions);
`exit 1` if < 95%.

---

## Part 5 — Coverage tooling & CI

- **`scripts/run_all_tests.sh`** — cargo test → run_ui_tests.sh → ctest → qml_coverage.py,
  aggregate pass/fail.
- **`scripts/coverage.sh`** — Rust llvm-cov + C++ lcov, merge → `coverage/merged-lcov.info`
  + genhtml, gate Rust+C++ merged ≥95, report QML behavior % separately.
- **CI overhaul (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
  - **Fix trigger:** `branches: [master]` (or `[main, master]`).
  - Keep `format`/`lint`/`audit`/`build`/`docs`.
  - Add **`qml-test`** (offscreen qmltestrunner + qml_coverage.py ≥95),
    **`cpp-test`** (`-DXENEON_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DXENEON_COVERAGE=ON` + ctest + lcov capture),
    **`coverage`** (needs `[test, cpp-test]`; llvm-cov + merge + ≥95 gate; upload artifact).
  - `concurrency` to cancel superseded runs.
- Update `AGENTS.md` §Test & Lint and `docs/testing/test-strategy.md` to match reality.

---

## Part 6 — Multi-agent execution model

Concurrent writers use **git worktrees** (or strict file ownership) and integrate
frequently; shared files (`CMakeLists.txt`, `ci.yml`, `main.cpp`) are single-owner.

**Wave 0 — Foundation (single-owner, sequential on shared files):**
- `A0-refactor` — C++ header extraction + baked-in bug fixes (Part 1 C++ + 2a).
- `A0-cmake` — `tests/cpp/` scaffolding, `XENEON_BUILD_TESTS`/`XENEON_COVERAGE`.
- `A0-ci` — CI branch fix + new jobs + coverage scripts.

**Wave 1 — Builders (parallel, isolated ownership):**
- `A1-rust` — owns `core/` (logging refactor+tests, ffi boundary, proptest).
- `A2-cpp-tests` — owns `tests/cpp/*.cpp` (after A0-refactor lands).
- `A3-qml-orch` — owns `tst_dashboard/main/manager/edgeclone`.
- `A4-qml-prim` — owns primitives/backgrounds/catalogs/theme/store_io/diagnostics/wizard.
- `A5-qml-net` — owns XHR factory seam (3 source files) + `tst_weather_net/calendar_net`.
- `A6-bug-verify` — full S1–S12 + HIGH re-verification; hands fixes to layer owners.

**Wave 2 — Assurance (the "outstanders" and "rubber duckies"):**
- `V1-outstander-cpp`, `V2-outstander-qml`, `V3-outstander-rust` — adversarial review of
  each layer's tests: do they *assert*, or just execute? Any test that can't fail is rejected.
- `D1-rubber-duck` — explain-back each nontrivial fix/test to catch flawed reasoning.
- `C1-coverage-auditor` — runs `coverage.sh` + `qml_coverage.py`, reports the true numbers,
  lists remaining uncovered behaviors, loops work back until ≥95% on every layer.
- `I1-integrator` — merges worktrees, resolves shared-file conflicts, runs
  `run_all_tests.sh` green, commits per Conventional Commits.

---

## Current verification entry points

The old six-step acceptance list has been replaced by maintained runners:

1. `./scripts/run_all_tests.sh` runs the development aggregate, including Rust,
   offscreen QML, C++, behavior coverage, runtime, Manager and compositor tiers.
2. `./scripts/coverage.sh` runs the maintained Rust/C++/merged/QML coverage gates.
3. Current real-device suites are `tests/hardware/edge_e2e.py`,
   `tests/hardware/e2e_buildup.py` and `tests/hardware/widget_render_matrix.py`;
   `edge_hw_test.py` is deprecated legacy coverage.
4. `./scripts/run_release_tests.sh` is the only complete strict pre-release entry
   point. It rejects missing prerequisites and hidden skips and adds exact-candidate
   hardware, performance and long-soak requirements.

A command existing or passing once does not certify a later candidate. Current
results belong in the release evidence, not in this historical plan.

---

## Historical results (executed 2026-07-13)

Delivered via a multi-agent fleet (7 builders → 6 assurance/remediation → 3 hardening →
coverage-wiring), each wave adversarially reviewed by "outstander" + rubber-duck agents.

**All gates GREEN** (`./scripts/run_all_tests.sh` → `RESULT: SUCCESS`):

| Layer | Tests | Coverage | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rust `core/` | 63 → **110** | **96.44%** line (logging 100, ffi 98.4, display 97.9, metrics 95.2, config 93.0) | ≥95 ✅ |
| C++ `app/`+`manager/` | 0 → **13 ctest** (unit+integration+smoke) | **97%** filtered line | ≥95 ✅ |
| QML | 45 → **68** files | **99.4%** behavior matrix (163/164) | ≥95 ✅ |

- **Enabling refactor** landed: `ConfigBridge`/`WizardBridge`/`MetricsWorker`/`ManagerBackend`
  + pure logic (`byteToRotation`, `reconcileOnPull`, `screenIdentityHash`, `sanitizeImageName`,
  `millideg_to_celsius`, `parse_cpu_line`) extracted to headers/free functions — all directly
  unit-tested; product Release build unchanged.
- **Debug sweep (full S1–S12 + HIGH re-verification):** S1–S9/S11/S12 + all discrete HIGH
  confirmed fixed with test gates. **Newly fixed this session:** S10 (added FFI getters +
  wired reconnect/notify/fallback into hub hotplug), two-writer save race (Manager is
  IPC-only writer when connected), page-name dedup on load, S5 RAM/GPU history sharing.
- **Bugs caught by the review agents and fixed:** XENEON_GRAB use-after-free; `metricsToJson`
  data race → atomic; hub `applyAutostart` optimistic return; EDID identity-hash duplication;
  a cross-module Rust test env-lock race; a non-monotonic-counter CPU overflow panic; the
  `-1.0`/NaN temp-sentinel semantic (real −1 °C no longer read as "unavailable"); **and the
  #7 single-writer edit-loss heisenbug** (live edit now supersedes a buffered offline edit) —
  its regression test was verified to fail without the fix.
- **Infra:** CI trigger fixed (`main`→`[main, master]`) + new `qml-test`/`cpp-test`/`coverage`
  jobs with ≥95 gates; `scripts/{run_all_tests,coverage,qml_coverage,run_cpp_tests}` added;
  coverage tooling (`cargo-llvm-cov`, `llvm-tools`, `gcovr`) installed without sudo.
- **Honest residuals:** `config.rs` 93% (below the per-file 95 but the total gate passes;
  a config corrupt-path IO test would close it); `fn:main.onContentRotationChanged` (input-method
  hide + fade restart — unobservable offscreen); `mpris_bridge.cpp`'s async D-Bus plumbing
  (genuinely needs a bus; its logic was extracted to `mpris_state.*` and is now 100% covered
  — see below) — all documented, none blocking.

## Historical residual notes

- The XHR factory seam and `level_filter`/`screenIdentityHash` extractions are small
  **production** changes made solely for testability — behavior-neutral, verified by the
  existing build + smoke.
- C++ coverage denominator excludes hardware/`main()`/live-`QScreen` paths by design; those
  are covered by smoke + the on-device Python E2E, which are not in the CI line-% math.
- `mpris_bridge.cpp`: the *decisions* (which player wins, what a reply means, whether QML is
  notified) were extracted to `app/src/mpris_state.{h,cpp}` and are unit-tested with no bus —
  `tests/cpp/tst_mpris_state.cpp`, 100% line coverage on `mpris_state.cpp`, `mpris_bridge.h`
  and the non-excluded part of `mpris_bridge.cpp`. Only the async D-Bus *plumbing* stays out
  of the denominator (`GCOVR_EXCL`, reason in-source): it needs a live bus and a live player,
  and is exercised by the on-device E2E. Note the marker is on the conversation, not the
  logic — a new decision belongs in `mpris_state.*`, not inside the excluded region.
