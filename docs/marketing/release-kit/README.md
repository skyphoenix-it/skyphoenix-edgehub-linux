# EdgeHub release campaign kit

**Status:** beta.1 launch material complete; publish with the release

**Target:** `v1.0.0-beta.1` - 2026-07-21

**Publication rule:** do not send availability posts until the signed source and
portable tarballs, checksums, and signatures are on the release URL.

This kit turns the repository's approved claim register into reusable launch
material without pretending that the current development branch is already a
release. It deliberately contains no price, store, broad-platform,
self-update, performance, or long-soak promise.
