# EdgeHub - Free vs Pro

*Internal entitlement audit, not store copy. No price, store, fulfilment, refund or
support offer is approved. Read the release blockers at the end before publishing.*

## What EdgeHub is

EdgeHub turns a Corsair Xeneon Edge - the 2560×720 secondary touchscreen - into a
native Linux widget dashboard. Swipeable pages of live widgets you arrange by
touch, right on the panel. It also runs on any other secondary or portrait
display.

A Rust core handles metrics and configuration; Qt 6/QML draws the interface.
There is no browser engine, no Electron, no bundled web server, and no account.
A companion desktop app, **EdgeHub Manager**, mirrors the Edge live so you can
design your layout from your main monitor.

Source: `README.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`

## The short version

**EdgeHub is free and complete. Pro is a cosmetic supporter tier.**

Pro adds 9 extra colour themes. That is the entire functional difference in the
current code. No widget, no layout feature, no data source and no part of the
Manager is behind the licence. If a theme pack is not worth money to you, the free
build is not a crippled version of anything - it is the whole product.

We would rather say that plainly than have you discover it after paying.

Counts verified against `ui/qml/WidgetCatalog.qml` (30 entries),
`ui/qml/PresetCatalog.qml` (19 entries), `ui/qml/Theme.qml` (`themeCatalog`,
29 entries of which 9 carry `pro: true`; `accentPresets`, 29 entries),
`ui/qml/BackgroundCatalog.qml` (Gradient plus 10 animated styles), `ui/qml/WallpaperCatalog.qml`
(18 bundled images).

## What Pro does **not** gate

This is the section that matters most, so it is explicit.

- **Every widget is free.** All 30 entries in `ui/qml/WidgetCatalog.qml` - including
  the live-data ones (HTTP/JSON, KPI), the system monitors, the focus and health
  widgets - carry no `pro` flag. There is no such flag in the widget registry at all.
- **Every preset screen is free.** All 19 entries in `ui/qml/PresetCatalog.qml`,
  including the developer, homelab, trading-desk, analyst and enterprise screens.
- **Every background style and every bundled wallpaper is free.** Neither catalog
  has a gating flag.
- **Every accent colour is free**, including the 8-colour Okabe–Ito palette chosen to
  stay distinguishable under protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia.
- **All layout features are free** - multi-page dashboards, every widget size, both
  orientations, drag/resize/reorder.
- **EdgeHub Manager is free**, in full.
- **Accessibility is free.** The high-contrast theme sits in the free Accessibility
  group; reduce-motion and touch-target sizing are unconditional.
- **Update access is not licence-gated.** This describes entitlement only; it does
  not claim that an auto-update artifact or store delivery route is available.
  A Pro key never expires unless it was explicitly issued with an expiry
  (`--expires` defaults to `never` - `docs/LICENSING.md`).
- **Nothing degrades if your licence lapses.** An expired key resolves to the free
  tier: your dashboards, widgets, layouts and data connections keep working
  untouched. Only the 9 Pro themes stop being selectable
  (`core/src/license.rs`, `Status::Expired → Tier::Free`).

The only gate in the codebase is one flag on nine theme entries and one
`license.isPro` check in each of the two theme pickers
(`ui/qml/widgets/SettingsPanel.qml`, `manager/qml/Manager.qml`).

## What the Pro entitlement currently changes

The implementation supports two possible motivations, but this is not a live sale:

1. **You want the themes.** Synthwave, Cyberpunk, Vaporwave, Matrix, and five
   distribution-flavoured looks (Keystone, Cascade, Swirl, Trilby, Fizz). They are
   original palettes, not reproductions of anyone's branding.
2. **A future supporter offering could fund the project.** EdgeHub is open source
   (MIT OR Apache-2.0), but no store or fulfilment route is asserted here.

The free build is not a trial and contains all functional features.

## Privacy and offline properties

These are verifiable claims, not marketing adjectives.

**Your licence never touches the network.** A Pro key is an offline, signed
`XE1.<payload>.<signature>` token verified against an Ed25519 public key compiled
into the app. Verifying it opens no socket, reads no file, and uses no hardware
fingerprint - the result is identical under `unshare -n`. There is no activation
server and no "phone home". The key is a transferable bearer entitlement whose
payload contains the holder label, so it is kept in owner-only `config.toml` and
omitted from logs and diagnostics. Entitlement is recomputed from the signature
every time rather than trusted from a stored flag.
Source: `core/src/license.rs`, `docs/LICENSING.md`, `app/src/license_bridge.h`

**It fails soft, never hard.** Any bad key - empty, garbage, forged, expired, or
signed for a future format - resolves to the free tier. It never panics and never
blocks the app.
Source: `core/src/license.rs` (`Status::Unlicensed`/`Expired` → `Tier::Free`),
covered by the unit tests in that file.

**One audited network choke point.** Every outbound request from every widget goes
through a single gate, `ui/qml/widgets/NetHub.qml`, which enforces a global offline
kill switch and an optional host allowlist. A CI lint
(`scripts/check_no_raw_xhr.sh`) fails the build the moment any file outside that
gate constructs its own `XMLHttpRequest`, with no exemption list. The gate's
ordering is tested offline against a fake transport in `tests/ui/tst_nethub.qml`.

**No telemetry, no account, no cloud.** EdgeHub reaches the network only for widgets
you explicitly configure - Weather, a calendar feed, or a data widget you pointed
somewhere - and all of it goes through the gate above.

## Honest note on how thin Pro currently is

Flagged for the owner, not for the store page.

- **Pro is 9 themes.** That is the whole delta. `docs/LICENSING.md` describes the
  *intent* as "premium themes, premium preset packs, and custom user widgets", but
  no preset carries a `pro` flag and `ui/qml/UserWidgetCatalog.qml` performs no
  licence check. Only themes are actually gated today.
- **The primary in-app copy is now specific.** The free-tier line says Pro adds
  nine themes. The expired-licence line still says "premium extras"; naming the
  themes there would be clearer before any sale.
- **Pricing remains undecided.** Nine cosmetic themes are the whole current delta;
  do not attach a price or feature-tier promise until the product, policy and
  fulfilment decisions are approved.
- **The "Get Pro" button points at a GitHub anchor** in
  `manager/qml/Manager.qml`, not a store. It must not imply that checkout or
  fulfilment is live.

## Release blockers - do not publish as a store page

Claims that appear in existing repo copy but that I could **not** confirm from the
code, or that depend on something outside it:

1. **Performance.** No approved candidate benchmark supports a public CPU, RSS,
   startup or endurance number.
2. **Release status.** The latest tag is `v1.0.0-alpha.2`; the current branch is
   unreleased and no feature freeze or code freeze has been declared.
3. **Purchase and delivery flow.** The repo contains licence tooling and webhook
   code, but that does not prove a live product, price or fulfilment pipeline.
4. **Refund policy, support commitments, and platform/distro compatibility list.**
   Not derivable from the code. Write these yourself.
5. **Theme screenshots.** Use fresh captures from the exact released candidate.
6. **Trademark posture of the "Inspired" themes.** The names were deliberately made
   non-nominative (Keystone, Cascade, Swirl, Trilby, Fizz) and the code comments
   claim no logo is reproduced. That is a design intent recorded in comments, not a
   legal review. Get one before shipping paid distro-flavoured cosmetics.
7. **Update delivery.** The AppImage/zsync update round trip has not been exercised
   against published artifacts; do not advertise auto-update.
