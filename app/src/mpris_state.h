//
// Everything here is a decision, not a conversation: which player to show, and
// what the now-playing card should say. None of it needs a session bus, so per
// the repo convention (AGENTS.md: "logic classes are extracted into headers so
// they're unit-testable") it lives out here where tests can drive it directly,
// while mpris_bridge.cpp keeps the async D-Bus plumbing that genuinely does
// need a bus.
//
// The one impurity is deliberate and called out at resolveTrack(): it stats the
// filesystem to validate a file:// art path. That is testable with a real temp
// file and needs no bus either.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

//      would make the card flap on every 3s rescan;
//   3. else take the first.
// `statuses` maps service -> PlaybackStatus, with "" for a player that did not
// answer (a hung/erroring player must not win). Returns "" iff `order` is empty.

//     fallback in the implementation);
//   * mpris:artUrl with a file:// scheme — VALIDATED against the filesystem and
//     CLEARED when unreadable, because Chromium advertises stale art paths and
//     QML's Image would emit "Cannot open". http(s) is passed through untouched.
//     This is the filesystem touch noted above.
//   * the availability rule — a service can be on the bus with no track loaded
//     (a browser tab that merely *can* play audio, or a just-stopped player).
//     `available` therefore requires a real title OR a Playing/Paused status;
//     otherwise every metadata field is blanked, so the UI shows "nothing
//     playing" rather than a blank card.

// changed() unconditionally re-fires every property NOTIFY, restarting the QML
// animations bound to them. Only a visible move may notify.
